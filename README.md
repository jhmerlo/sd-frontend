# Solidariedade Digital

Client-side of a multiscreen application developed to the management of the project "Solidariedade Digital" at UFES.

Reading, recording and updating data is a fundamental part of many processes in which
they are inserted. In an electronic device maintenance process, it is good practice to carry
out a series of records of components, parts and specifications, with due consultation and
updating when necessary. Often, the volume of data generated is expressive and can become
confusing. Thus, the use of electronic spreadsheets for the purpose of a database can
bring a number of disadvantages, such as the absence or misapplication of data validation,
duplication of records, misinformation arrays and poorer performance on relationships
between tables. This work describes an application based on the REST architecture style,
which makes it possible to manage the maintenance of the devices of the “Solidariedade
Digital” project. The application proposal seeks a multiplatform interface that guarantees
a better arrangement of records, connected to an API and a database, where the logics and
validations of the transactions are defined. To unfold the project, the TDD development
methodology will be used applied both on the client side and on the server side. It is
proposed to implement version control and usage documentation during the development
of the application to ensure its maintainability.
